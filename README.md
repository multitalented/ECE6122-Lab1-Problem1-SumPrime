Sum of Primes:

This program takes one command line input and calculates the sum of all primes equal to and below this number.
For example, an input of 13 will generate the primes of 13 11 7 5 3 2 and a sum of 41
The resulting sum is output to a file calling Output1.txt


Example execution in command line:

~$  g++ .\*.cpp a.exe

~$  a.exe 13

~$ cat Output1.txt

41
